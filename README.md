# INSTAGRAM REACH ANALYSIS
Python EDA project using instagram data 

Below are all the features in the data:
1. Impressions: Number of impressions in a post (Reach)
2. From Home: Reach from home
3. From Hashtags: Reach from Hashtags
4. From Explore: Reach from Explore
5. From Other: Reach from other sources
6. Saves: Number of saves
7. Comments: Number of comments
8. Shares: Number of shares
9. Likes: Number of Likes
10. Profile Visits: Numer of profile visits from the post
11. Follows: Number of Follows from the post
12. Caption: Caption of the post
13. Hashtags: Hashtags used in the post

Steps taken:
- Import necessary libraries.
- Load and overview data
    - The encoding='latin1' parameter in the pd.read_csv() function specifies the character encoding used to read the CSV file.
    - Use it when your CSV file contains characters that are not supported by the default UTF-8 encoding.
    - Use it if you encounter a UnicodeDecodeError while reading the file.
- View column info of dataset
- View descriptive statistics of dataset
- Check data for inconsistencies (null values)
- Create a histogram for the 'Impressions' column
- Create a line plot showing trend of impressions over time.
    - The dataset doesnâ€™t explicitly have a time-based column (e.g., a date or timestamp).
    - Hence I used the row index (data.index) as the x-axis.
    - In other use cases, this might not be meaningful unless the rows are ordered chronologically.
- Create a multi-line plot that shows the trends of Likes, Saves, and Follows over time.
    - Once again, I use the row index (data.index) as the x-axis.
- Create a pie chart that visualizes the distribution of reach (impressions) from different sources: From Home, From Hashtags, From Explore, and From Other.
- Create a pie chart that visualizes the distribution of engagement metrics: Saves, Comments, Shares, and Likes.
- Create a scatter plot with a trendline to visualize the relationship between Profile Visits and Follows.
- Create a word cloud for the hashtags used in the Instagram posts.
    - plotly.express (px) does not directly support creating word clouds. 
    - The WordCloud library from wordcloud can be used to generate the word cloud and then display it using matplotlib.
- Create a correlation matrix heatmap to visualize the relationships (correlations) between different numerical features in your dataset.
- Create a correlation matrix heatmap to xplore the relationships between different metrics (e.g., impressions, likes, comments, shares) to identify patterns.
- Create a bar chart that visualizes the distribution of the top 25 hashtags used in the Instagram posts.
- Create two bar charts to visualize the distribution of top 25 Likes and Impressions for each hashtag used.
- Create a histogram to to analyze the sentiment of the captions (positive, negative, neutral), with the sentiment analysis library TextBlob.
- Use a scatterplot to analyze the relationship between profile visits and new followers to understand how effectively profile visits convert into followers.
- Use a scatterplot to analyze how the length of your captions (number of words or characters) affects engagement.

## Constraints
- Captions were too long, so it was not impossible to make visalizations about them.
- There was no timestamp or date column, therefore we were limited and couldn't make Time-based analysis
